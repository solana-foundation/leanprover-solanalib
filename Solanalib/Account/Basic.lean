# Accounts

The Solana account model. An on-chain account carries five fields: its
lamport balance (u64), the program that owns it, an opaque data blob, an
executable flag (true for programs, false for data accounts), and the
rent epoch at which rent next comes due.

`Account.lamports` is a `Lamports` (= `UInt64`), so `credit` and `debit`
carry **explicit no-overflow / no-underflow preconditions** in their type
signatures. The compiler will reject any call site that hasn't proved the
relevant bound — modelling the Solana convention of `checked_add` /
`checked_sub` returning `Err` on overflow, but at the type level.

## Main definitions

* `Solanalib.Account` — the five-field on-chain account record.
* `Solanalib.Account.credit` — credit lamports, requires `lhs + rhs < 2^64`.
* `Solanalib.Account.debit`  — debit lamports, requires `amount ≤ balance`.

## Main statements

Projection `@[simp]` lemmas for every field of every operation, so `simp`
can chain through `.field` accesses uniformly. The `credit_lamports_toNat`
and `debit_lamports_toNat` variants drop the result into `Nat` for
conservation-style reasoning where `omega` does the heavy lifting.

Requires a proof `h` that the resulting balance fits in `u64`, so the
underlying `UInt64` addition can never silently wrap. This mirrors what
production Solana code does with `checked_add`, but lifted to a
compile-time obligation. -/
