# Pubkey

A Solana public key — a 32-byte identifier used as the address of every
account on the cluster. Real on-chain pubkeys are interpreted in two
ways depending on context: as compressed Ed25519 curve points (regular
wallet/program addresses) or as off-curve hashes (Program Derived
Addresses). This module captures the raw byte-array shape; the curve /
PDA distinction is layered on in `Solanalib.Pda`.

## Main definitions

* `Solanalib.Pubkey` — the 32-byte identifier wrapper.

## Implementation notes

The 32-byte length constraint is not yet enforced in the type. A later
refinement will replace `ByteArray` with a length-indexed `Vector UInt8 32`
once we have a use site that actually needs the bound. For algebraic
theorems about pubkey equality, the current shape is sufficient.

-- `ByteArray` ships without a `Repr` instance in Lean core; derive one
-- here so anything containing a `ByteArray` (Pubkey, Account.data, …) can
-- itself derive `Repr`.

Intentionally **not** tagged `@[ext]`. Tagging it would cause the `ext`
tactic on enclosing types (e.g. `Account`) to descend through the `owner`
field into byte-array internals, generating goals about `ByteArray.data.size`
that we don't want to discharge. If a future theorem genuinely needs
byte-level pubkey extensionality, use `Pubkey.mk.injEq` directly. -/
